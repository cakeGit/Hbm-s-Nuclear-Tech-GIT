# Cake's port of HBM Nuclear Tech Mod to 1.19.2

This is a fork of [TheOriginalGolem](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT) from a 1.12.2 port made by [Drillgon2000](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT). This is instead aimed to bring the mod up to 1.19.2 version of the game, if new content is added into Golem's fork I will try to pull it up to this version

The latest version can be found on https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hbms-nuclear-tech-mod-reloaded or under the [releases page](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases).
